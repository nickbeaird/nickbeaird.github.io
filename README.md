> QA Automation Engineer, Improviser, and non-stop Dog Dad seeks new opportunities in software development. 

I currently work as a QA Automation Engineeer at CloudBolt, a Cloud Management Platform. As I write home often, I write software that tests software. In my personal tech journey I am currently diving deep on testing strategies and am highly interested in expending my scope of practice in all things application development. This can be seen on the job pushing for modern testing strategies and tooling and at home with personal toy projects. In my free time I am a comedian. I have been performing improv and sketch all across the pacific northwest for the past 10 years. When things settle back down, you can find me at Kickstand Comedy Space in downtown Portland Oregon. Until then, peronaal tech projects and dog walks will be my favorite pastime.
